    The model is used to predict scores for all tails and all heads for each triple. Subsequently, each abstract
    evaluator is applied to the scores, also receiving the batch itself (e.g. to compute entity-specific metrics).
    Thereby, the (potentially) expensive score computation against all entities is done only once. The metric evaluators
    are expected to maintain their own internal buffers. They are returned after running the evaluation, and should
    offer a possibility to extract some final metrics.

    :param model:
        The model to evaluate.
    :param mapped_triples:
        The triples on which to evaluate. The mapped triples should never contain inverse triples - these are created by
        the model class on the fly.
    :param evaluator:
        The evaluator.
    :param only_size_probing:
        The evaluation is only performed for two batches to test the memory footprint, especially on GPUs.
    :param batch_size: >0
        A positive integer used as batch size. Generally chosen as large as possible. Defaults to 1 if None.
    :param slice_size: >0
        The divisor for the scoring function when using slicing.

        The device on which the evaluation shall be run. If None is given, use the model's device.

        Should a progress bar be displayed?
    :param tqdm_kwargs:
        Additional keyword based arguments passed to the progress bar.
    :param restrict_entities_to:
        Optionally restrict the evaluation to the given entity IDs. This may be useful if one is only interested in a
        part of the entities, e.g. due to type constraints, but wants to train on all available data. For ranking the
        entities, we still compute all scores for all possible replacement entities to avoid irregular access patterns
        which might decrease performance, but the scores will afterwards be filtered to only keep those of interest.
        If provided, we assume by default that the triples are already filtered, such that it only contains the
        entities of interest. To explicitly filter within this method, pass `pre_filtered_triples=False`.
    :param restrict_relations_to:
        Optionally restrict the evaluation to the given relation IDs. This may be useful if one is only interested in a
        part of the relations, e.g. due to relation types, but wants to train on all available data. If provided, we
        assume by default that the triples are already filtered, such that it only contains the relations of interest.
        To explicitly filter within this method, pass `pre_filtered_triples=False`.
    :param do_time_consuming_checks:
        Whether to perform some time consuming checks on the provided arguments. Currently, this encompasses:
        - If restrict_entities_to or restrict_relations_to is not None, check whether the triples have been filtered.
        Disabling this option can accelerate the method. Only effective if pre_filtered_triples is set to True.
    :param pre_filtered_triples:
        Whether the triples have been pre-filtered to adhere to restrict_entities_to / restrict_relations_to. When set
        to True, and the triples have *not* been filtered, the results may be invalid. Pre-filtering the triples
        accelerates this method, and is recommended when evaluating multiple times on the same set of triples.
    :param additional_filtered_triples:
        Additional true triples to filter out during filtered evaluation.
