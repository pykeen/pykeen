    """The Hetionet dataset is a large biological network.

    In its publication [himmelstein2017]_, it is demonstrated to be useful for link prediction in drug repositioning
    and made publicly available through its `GitHub repository <https://github.com/hetio/hetionet>`_ in several formats.
    The link prediction algorithm showcased does not rely on embeddings, which leaves room for interesting comparison.
    One such comparison was made during the master's thesis of Lingling Xu [xu2019]_.

    For reproducibility, the random_state argument is set by default to 0. For permutation studies, you can change
    this.
