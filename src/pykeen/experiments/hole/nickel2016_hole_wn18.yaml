  title: "Learn WN18 Dataset with HolE as described by Nickel et al., 2016"
  comments: "Based on https://github.com/mnick/holographic-embeddings/blob/master/run_hole_wn18.sh, however it is not sure whether this is the correct setting. The evaluation uses the non-deterministic rank, as seen from https://github.com/mnick/holographic-embeddings/blob/c2db6e1554e671ab8e6acace78ec1fd91d6a4b90/kg/base.py#L198."
