## Installation ![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pykeen) ![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pykeen)

The latest stable version of PyKEEN requires Python 3.8+. It can be downloaded
and installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pykeen) with:

```shell
pip install pykeen
```

The latest version of PyKEEN can be installed directly from the
source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen) with:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen.git
```

More information about installation (e.g., development mode, Windows installation, Colab, Kaggle, extras)
can be found in the [installation documentation](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Quickstart [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pykeen/badge/?version=latest)](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This example shows how to train a model on a dataset and test on another dataset.

The fastest way to get up and running is to use the pipeline function. It
provides a high-level entry into the extensible functionality of this package.
The following example shows how to train and evaluate the [TransE](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pykeen.models.TransE.html#pykeen.models.TransE)
model on the [Nations](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pykeen.datasets.Nations.html#pykeen.datasets.Nations)
dataset. By default, the training loop uses the [stochastic local closed world assumption (sLCWA)](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/training.html#pykeen.training.SLCWATrainingLoop)
training approach and evaluates with [rank-based evaluation](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/evaluation/rank_based.html#pykeen.evaluation.RankBasedEvaluator).

```python
from pykeen.pipeline import pipeline

result = pipeline(
    model='TransE',
    dataset='nations',
)
```

The results are returned in an instance of the [PipelineResult](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pipeline.html#pykeen.pipeline.PipelineResult)
dataclass that has attributes for the trained model, the training loop, the evaluation, and more. See the tutorials
on [using your own dataset](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/byo/data.html),
[understanding the evaluation](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/understanding_evaluation.html),
and [making novel link predictions](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/making_predictions.html).

PyKEEN is extensible such that:

- Each model has the same API, so anything from ``pykeen.models`` can be dropped in
- Each training loop has the same API, so ``pykeen.training.LCWATrainingLoop`` can be dropped in
- Triples factories can be generated by the user with ``from pykeen.triples.TriplesFactory``

The full documentation can be found at https://pykeen.readthedocs.io.

## Implementation

Below are the models, datasets, training modes, evaluators, and metrics implemented
in ``pykeen``.

### Datasets 

The following {{ n_datasets }} datasets are built in to PyKEEN. The citation for each dataset corresponds to either the paper
describing the dataset, the first paper published using the dataset with knowledge graph embedding models,
or the URL for the dataset if neither of the first two are available. If you want to use a custom dataset,
see the [Bring Your Own Dataset](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/byo/data.html) tutorial. If you
have a suggestion for another dataset to include in PyKEEN, please let us know
[here](https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/new?assignees=cthoyt&labels=New+Dataset&template=dataset-request.md&title=Add+%5BDATASET+NAME%5D).

## Experimentation

### Reproduction

PyKEEN includes a set of curated experimental settings for reproducing past landmark
experiments. They can be accessed and run like:

```shell
pykeen experiments reproduce tucker balazevic2019 fb15k
```

Where the three arguments are the model name, the reference, and the dataset.
The output directory can be optionally set with `-d`.

### Ablation

PyKEEN includes the ability to specify ablation studies using the
hyper-parameter optimization module. They can be run like:

```shell
pykeen experiments ablation ~/path/to/config.json
```

### Large-scale Reproducibility and Benchmarking Study

We used PyKEEN to perform a large-scale reproducibility and benchmarking study which are described in
[our article](https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3124805):

```bibtex
@article{ali2020benchmarking,
  author={Ali, Mehdi and Berrendorf, Max and Hoyt, Charles Tapley and Vermue, Laurent and Galkin, Mikhail and Sharifzadeh, Sahand and Fischer, Asja and Tresp, Volker and Lehmann, Jens},
  journal={IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence},
  title={Bringing Light Into the Dark: A Large-scale Evaluation of Knowledge Graph Embedding Models under a Unified Framework},
  year={2021},
  pages={1-1},
  doi={10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3124805}}
}
```

We have made all code, experimental configurations, results, and analyses that lead to our interpretations available
at https://github.com/pykeen/benchmarking.
