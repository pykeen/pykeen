"""Remixing and dataset distance utilities.

Most datasets are given in with a pre-defined split, but it's often not discussed
how this split was created. This module contains utilities for investigating the
effects of remixing pre-split datasets like :class`pykeen.datasets.Nations`.

Further, it defines a metric for the "distance" between two splits of a given dataset.
Later, this will be used to map the landscape and see if there is a smooth, continuous
relationship between datasets' splits' distances and their maximum performance.
