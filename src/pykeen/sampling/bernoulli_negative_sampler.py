class BernoulliNegativeSampler(NegativeSampler):
    r"""An implementation of the Bernoulli negative sampling approach proposed by [wang2014]_.

    The probability of corrupting the head $h$ or tail $t$ in a relation $(h,r,t) \in \mathcal{K}$
    is determined by global properties of the relation $r$:

    - $r$ is *one-to-many* (e.g. *motherOf*): a higher probability is assigned to replace $h$
    - $r$ is *many-to-one* (e.g. *bornIn*): a higher probability is assigned to replace $t$.

    More precisely, for each relation $r \in \mathcal{R}$, the average number of tails per head
    (``tph``) and heads per tail (``hpt``) are first computed.

    Then, the head corruption probability $p_r$ is defined as $p_r = \frac{tph}{tph + hpt}$.
    The tail corruption probability is defined as $1 - p_r = \frac{hpt}{tph + hpt}$.

    For each triple $(h,r,t) \in \mathcal{K}$, the head is corrupted with probability $p_r$ and the tail is
    corrupted with probability $1 - p_r$.

    If ``filtered`` is set to ``True``, all proposed corrupted triples that also exist as
    actual positive triples $(h,r,t) \in \mathcal{K}$ will be removed.
