    This negative sampler that corrupts positive triples $(h,r,t) \in \mathcal{K}$ by replacing either $h$ or $t$.

    Steps:

    1. Randomly (uniformly) determine whether $h$ or $t$ shall be corrupted for a positive triple
       $(h,r,t) \in \mathcal{K}$.
    2. Randomly (uniformly) sample an entity $e \in \mathcal{E}$ for selection to corrupt the triple.

       - If $h$ was selected before, the corrupted triple is $(e,r,t)$
       - If $t$ was selected before, the corrupted triple is $(h,r,e)$
