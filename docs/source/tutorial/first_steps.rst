First Steps
===========
.. automodule:: pykeen.pipeline.api

Loading a pre-trained Model
---------------------------
Many of the previous examples ended with saving the results using the
:meth:`pykeen.pipeline.PipelineResult.save_to_directory`. One of the
artifacts written to the given directory is the ``trained_model.pkl``
file. Because all PyKEEN models inherit from :class:`torch.nn.Module`,
we use the PyTorch mechanisms for saving and loading them. This means
that you can use :func:`torch.load` to load a model like:

.. code-block:: python

    import torch

    my_pykeen_model = torch.load('trained_model.pkl')

More information on PyTorch's model persistence can be found at:
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html.

Using Learned Embeddings
------------------------
The embeddings learned for entities and relations are not only useful for link
prediction (see :ref:`making_predictions`), but also for other downstream machine
learning tasks like clustering, regression, and classification.

The embeddings themselves are typically stored in an instance of
:class:`pykeen.nn.emb.Embedding`, which wraps the :class:`torch.nn.Embedding`
and extends the more general :class:`pykeen.nn.emb.RepresentationModule` class.
All entity representations can be accessed from a model with the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from pykeen.pipeline import pipeline

    result = pipeline(model='TransE', dataset='UMLS')
    model = result.model

    entity_embeddings: torch.FloatTensor = model.entity_embeddings()

or more explicitly:

.. code-block:: python

    entity_embeddings: torch.FloatTensor = model.entity_embeddings(indices=None)

If you'd like to only look up certain embeddings, you can use the ``indices`` parameter
and pass a :class:`torch.LongTensor` with their corresponding indices.

Some models, like :class:`pykeen.models.TransD` have more than one embedding for entities.
Old-style models (e.g., ones inheriting from :class:`pykeen.models.EntityRelationEmbeddingModel`)
define one embedding as primary (e.g., :data:`pykeen.models.TransD.entity_embedding`) and others
are considered as secondary (e.g., :data:`pykeen.models.TransD.entity_projections`).

New-style models (e.g., ones inheriting from :class:`pykeen.models.ERModel`) are
generalized to easier allow for multiple entity representations and
relation representations. These models have two lists of entity and relation
representations respectively. You can access them via

.. code-block:: python

    entity_representation_modules:   List['pykeen.nn.Embedding'] = model.entity_representations
    relation_representation_modules: List['pykeen.nn.Embedding'] = model.relation_representations

If you want to obtain a single representation, you can index this list then call the function
to unwrap the embeddings, e.g.

.. code-block:: python

    first_entity_representation_module: 'pykeen.nn.Embedding' = entity_representations[0]
    first_entity_representations: torch.FloatTensor = first_entity_representations_module()

and treat them as before. The ordering in this list corresponds to the
ordering of representations defined in the interaction function. Some
models may provide Pythonic properties that provide a vanity attribute
to the instance of the class for a specific entity or relation representation.

Beyond the Pipeline
-------------------
While the pipeline provides a high-level interface, each aspect of the
training process is encapsulated in classes that can be more finely
tuned or subclassed. Below is an example of code that might have been
executed with one of the previous examples.

.. code-block:: python

    # Get a training dataset
    from pykeen.datasets import Nations
    dataset = Nations()
    training_triples_factory = dataset.training

    # Pick a model
    from pykeen.models import TransE
    model = TransE(triples_factory=training_triples_factory)

    # Pick an optimizer from Torch
    from torch.optim import Adam
    optimizer = Adam(params=model.get_grad_params())

    # Pick a training approach (sLCWA or LCWA)
    from pykeen.training import SLCWATrainingLoop
    training_loop = SLCWATrainingLoop(model=model, optimizer=optimizer)

    # Train like Cristiano Ronaldo
    training_loop.train(num_epochs=5, batch_size=256)

    # Pick an evaluator
    from pykeen.evaluation import RankBasedEvaluator
    evaluator = RankBasedEvaluator()

    # Get triples to test
    mapped_triples = dataset.testing.mapped_triples

    # Evaluate
    results = evaluator.evaluate(model, mapped_triples, batch_size=1024)
    print(results)
