`1.3.0 <https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/compare/v1.1.0...v1.3.0>`_ - 2021-02-15
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We skipped version 1.2.0 because we made an accidental release before this version
was ready. We're only human, and are looking into improving our release workflow
to live in CI/CD so something like this doesn't happen again. However, as an end user,
this won't have an effect on you.

New Datasets
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- CSKG (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/pull/249)

- CSV Tracker (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/pull/254)
- JSON Tracker (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/pull/254)

Fixed
~~~~~
- Fixed ComplEx's implementation (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/pull/313)
- Fixed OGB's reuse entity identifiers (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/pull/318, thanks @tgebhart)

Added
~~~~~
- ``pykeen version`` command for more easily reporting your environment in issues
  (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/251)
- Functional forms of all interaction models (e.g., TransE, RotatE) (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/238,
  `pykeen.nn.functional documentation <https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/nn/functional.html>`_). These
  can be generally reused, even outside of the typical PyKEEN workflows.
- Modular forms of all interaction models (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/242,
  `pykeen.nn.modules documentation <https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/nn/modules.html>`_). These wrap
  the functional forms of interaction models and store hyper-parameters such as the ``p`` value for the L_p norm in
  TransE.
- The initializer, normalizer, and constrainer for the entity and relation embeddings are now exposed through the
  ``__init__()`` function of each KGEM class and can be configured. A future update will enable HPO on these as well
  (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/282).

Refactoring and Future Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This release contains a few big refactors. Most won't affect end-users, but if you're writing your own PyKEEN
models, these are important. Many of them are motivated to make it possible to introduce a new interface that makes
it much easier for researchers (who shouldn't have to understand the inner workings of PyKEEN) to make new models.

- The regularizer has been refactored (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/266,
  https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/274). It no longer accepts a ``torch.device`` when instantiated.
- The ``pykeen.nn.Embedding`` class has been improved in several ways:
  - Embedding Specification class makes it easier to write new classes (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/277)
  - Refactor to make shape of embedding explicit (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/287)
  - Specification of complex datatype (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/292)
- Refactoring of the loss model class to provide a meaningful class hierarchy
  (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/256, https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/262)
- Refactoring of the base model class to provide a consistent interface (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/246,
  https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/248, https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/253,
  https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/257). This allowed for simplification of the loss computation based on
  the new hierarchy and also new implementation of regularizer class.
- More automated testing of typing with MyPy (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/255) and automated checking
  of documentation with ``doctests`` (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/291)

Triples Loading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We've made some improvements to the ``pykeen.triples.TriplesFactory`` to facilitate loading even larger datasets
(https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/216). However, this required an interface change. This will affect any
code that loads custom triples. If you're loading triples from a path, you should now use:

.. code-block:: python

    path = ...

    # Old (doesn't work anymore)
    tf = TriplesFactory(path=path)

    # New
    tf = TriplesFactory.from_path(path)

Predictions
~~~~~~~~~~~
While refactoring the base model class, we excised the prediction functionality to a new module
``pykeen.models.predict`` (docs: https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/predict.html#functions).
We also renamed some of the prediction functions inside the base model to make them more consistent, but we now
recommend you use the functions from ``pykeen.models.predict`` instead.

- ``Model.predict_heads()`` -> ``Model.get_head_prediction_df()``
- ``Model.predict_relations()`` -> ``Model.get_head_prediction_df()``
- ``Model.predict_tails()`` -> ``Model.get_head_prediction_df()``
- ``Model.score_all_triples()`` -> ``Model.get_all_prediction_df()``

Fixed
~~~~~
- Do not create inverse triples for validation and testing factory (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/270)
- Treat nonzero applied to large tensor error as OOM for batch size search (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/279)
- Fix bug in loading ConceptNet (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/290). If your experiments relied on this
  dataset, you should rerun them.
